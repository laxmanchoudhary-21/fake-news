## 🔧 Configuration

### Free Operation (Default)
The app works completely free without any API keys:
- RSS feeds for news verification
- Wikipedia for fact-checking
- Local AI models for classification
- Offline deepfake detection

### Enhanced Operation (Optional)
Add API keys for more sources:

**Streamlit Secrets** (`/.streamlit/secrets.toml`):
```toml
[api_keys]
newsapi_key = "your_newsapi_key"
newsdata_key = "your_newsdata_key"
google_factcheck_key = "your_google_key"
```

**Environment Variables**:
```bash
export NEWSAPI_KEY="your_key"
export NEWSDATA_KEY="your_key" 
export GOOGLE_FACTCHECK_KEY="your_key"
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
```bash
# Missing dependencies
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

# Model loading errors  
# → Models auto-download on first run, be patient

# Memory issues on free hosting
# → Reduce max_video_frames in config

# API timeouts
# → App works without APIs, uses RSS fallbacks
```

- Enable caching (default on)
- Reduce video frame limits
- Use lighter AI models for faster response

## 📈 Scaling for Production

### Performance
- Add Redis for distributed caching  
- Implement async processing
- Load balance multiple instances

### Features
- User authentication
- Analysis history database
- Real-time monitoring
- API rate limiting

### Deployment
- Docker containerization
- Kubernetes orchestration
